There is a number of different ways to setup the application. 

*Probably further reading regarding node.js setup on web server is needed. Technologies used are Angular and Node.js/Express, so searching for MEAN (Mongo,Express, Angular, Node) stack might be helpful, and while doing that ignore the MongoDB part, as that is not used in the app.
